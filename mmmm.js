The YDM-4 has been the most successful diesel locomotive in the metre gauge operation of Indian Railways. The YDM-4A is a variant of the YDM-4 supplied by MLW . Originally equipped with vacuum brakes. Some were later equipped with dual brakes, particularly those working in the Northeast Frontier Railway were retrofitted with dual brake system by Lumding shed. ")

It is considered to be a successful locomotive class with high reliability and few maintenance problems. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like WDG-4 and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both in mainline and departmental duties. As of April 2022, 1047 locomotives still retain operational status on the mainline as WDG-3A, with a few examples having been converted to WAGC3 or WAG-10.")
